  "text": "Over the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) has been a subject of intense media hype. Machine learning, deep learning, and AI come up in countless articles, often outside of technology-minded publications. Artificial intelligence was born in the 1950s, when a handful of pioneers from the nascent field of computer science started asking whether computers could be made to 'think'. Concisely, AI can be described as the effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans. Early chess programs only involved hardcoded rules crafted by programmers and didn't qualify as machine learning. This approach is known as symbolic AI. A new approach arose to take symbolic AI's place: machine learning. The usual way to make a computer do useful work is to have a human programmer write down rules to be followed to turn input data into appropriate answers. Machine learning turns this around: the machine looks at the input data and the corresponding answers, and figures out what the rules should be. A machine learning system is trained rather than explicitly programmed. The central problem in machine learning and deep learning is to meaningfully transform data: in other words, to learn useful representations of the input data at hand. Deep learning is a specific subfield of machine learning; it's a new take on learning representations from data, which emphasizes learning successive layers of increasingly meaningful representations. In deep learning, these layered representations are learned via models called neural networks. The specification of what a layer does to its input data is stored in the layer's weights. The loss function takes the predictions of the network and the true target and computes a distance score, capturing how well the network has done. The fundamental trick in deep learning is to use this score as a feedback signal to adjust the value of the weights a little, in a direction that will lower the loss score for the current example. This adjustment is the job of the optimizer, which implements what's called the Backpropagation algorithm. Deep learning makes problem solving much easier, because it automates what used to be the most crucial step in a machine learning workflow: feature engineering. Generative AI is powered by very large 'foundation models' that learn to reconstruct the text and image content fed into them. This is referred to as self-supervised learning, and it enables those models to use vast amounts of unlabeled data.",
